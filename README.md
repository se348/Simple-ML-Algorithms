# Simple Linear Regression and K-Means Clustering

This repository contains implementations of two fundamental machine learning algorithms:

## Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is a linear regression model that fits a straight line to a dataset with a single input variable to predict a continuous output variable. It finds the best-fitting line using the least squares method, aiming to minimize the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

## K-Means Clustering

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to group data points into K clusters based on their similarity. It partitions the data into clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances between each data point and the centroid of its assigned cluster.

Both algorithms are implemented in Python and showcased using a sample dataset.

## Getting Started

To explore the implementations and run the algorithms on your own datasets, follow the instructions provided in each algorithm's respective folder.

## Dependencies

The implementations use standard Python libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, for data manipulation and visualization. Ensure you have these dependencies installed before running the code.

## Acknowledgments

These implementations serve as foundational examples of linear regression and k-means clustering. They provide valuable insights into their respective concepts and can be used as starting points for more complex machine learning projects.
